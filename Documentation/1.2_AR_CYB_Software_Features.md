### **Videos:**

1. Collaboration across distance, using drawings, placing basic shapes, visualizing sensors [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KZSE4QPfTHj3jbhIBTPFOLzrDWcKLnGl/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KZSE4QPfTHj3jbhIBTPFOLzrDWcKLnGl/view?usp=sharing) 

2. Newer features like importing images, step-by-step control of a presentation, drawing tooltips, importing 3D models, dynamically animating shapes with sensor data

### **Current software features**

 **Collaboration features**: allow students to be aware of each other and direct each others’ awareness.

* Drawing in 3D
* Pointing using virtual lasers
* (seeing students who are connected remotely)

**External media features:** allow creation of 3D objects (from presets or imported from the web), and 2D images (from the web)

* Import images from the web
* Place 3D basic shapes (boxes, triangles, spheres, springs, …)
* Import 3D models from the web [not animated]

**Location information features:** allow for easier description of elements in space

* Arrows pointing at locations
* Tooltips with text labels
* Area indicators

**Sensors and Effects features:** allow data from the real world (ex: hand movements, robot sensor data) to be influencing virtual elements (ex: graphs, or transformations on the virtual elements)

* Sensor charts 
* Pre-created simulations (ex: proximity sensor)
* Effects applied to objects (ex: shrink/grow, rotate, move, glow)

**Presentation features:** allow students to enable/disable visual elements in order to create step-by-step presentations

* Step-by-step control of what visual elements are shown at any given time
