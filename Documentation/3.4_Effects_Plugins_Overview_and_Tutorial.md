# 3.4. Effects Plugins Overview and Tutorial


## Plugin System Overview and Tutorial

In our library, a plugin controls the visual transformations applied to an object beyond the base transformations available directly on the EffectsMenu itself. If you are not familiar with the Effects Menu please read the [documentation](./3.3_Effects_Menu_and_Visual_Effects_.md). 

Some plugins are applied **before** normal effects (e.g. the Delay effect, which allows multiple objects to respond to the same signal after delays of different lengths)

Some plugins are applied **after** normal effects (e.g. the path plugin, which moves an object along a path.)

A completed plugin must implement the required functions in these abstract classes:



*  <span style="color: blue;">EP\_&lt;PluginName>_Manager.cs</span>, which inherits from the abstract class <span style="color: blue;">AEffect4PluginManager.cs</span>
    * This is the main class to control plugin behavior. The important function that drives the main behavior is <span style="color: green;"><ins>RespondToNewValue</ins></span>, which specifies how the target object’s position, rotation and scale should change based on the incoming sensor values from a data channel.
* <span style="color: blue;">EP\_&lt;PluginName>_Model.cs</span>, which inherits from the abstract class <span style="color: blue;">AEffect4PluginModel.cs</span>
    * This class needs the user to specify all the parameters the plugin requires, and implement the function <span style="color: green;"><ins>DoPhotonSerialize</ins></span> to update them over the Photon network.
* <span style="color: blue;">EP\_&lt;PluginName>_Menu.cs</span>, which inherits from the abstract class <span style="color: blue;">AEffect4PluginMenu.cs</span>, is optional. So far none of our plugins have implemented a menu GUI, this abstract class is a stand-in for what may be future GUI implementations of plugins.

## 1. Setting up the <span style="color: blue;">EP\_&lt;PluginName>_Manager.cs</span> script

We have defined <span style="color: blue;">EP\_RandomScale_Manager.cs, EP\_RandomScale_Model.cs, and EP\_RandomScale_Menu.cs</span>, which inherit from each of the above abstract classes respectively. 

<span style="color: blue;">EP\_RandomScale_Manager.cs</span> must implement the <span style="color: green;"><ins>GetPluginName</ins></span> function (simply returning a string with the name of the plugin) and the <span style="color: green;"><ins>RespondToNewValue</ins></span> function by specifying what the object’s new position, rotation, and scale are, based on the incoming sensor value and the previous position & rotation. 

In the <span style="color: green;"><ins>RespondToNewValue</ins></span> function for RandomScale we will change the scale and leave the position and rotation unchanged. Thirdly, this script must implement the function <span style="color: green;"><ins>ToggleMenuGui</ins></span>, discussed in section 4 below.

</picture></br></br>



## 2. Setting up the <span style="color:blue;">EP\_&lt;PluginName>_Model.cs</span> script

<span style="color:blue;">EP\_RandomScale_Model.cs</span> is a simpler script to implement, since we just specify any parameters used in <span style="color:blue;">EP\_RandomScale_Manager.cs</span> and specify the order in which they are updated over the Photon network in the <span style="color:blue;">DoPhotonSerialize</span> function. Note that we are not really doing much in the <span style="color:green;"><ins>DoPhotonSerialize</ins></span> function, we are only sending the parameters into the stream if <span style="color:yellow;">***isWriting***</span> is true, and reading the parameters from the stream if <span style="color:yellow;">***isWriting***</span> is false.

</picture></br></br>


## 3. Setting up the <span style="color:blue;">EP\_&lt;PluginName>_Menu.cs</span> script

**Rendering the menu in <span style="color:blue;">EP\_&lt;PluginName>_Menu.cs**</span>

<picture>
  <img alt="menu size and position.png" src="./Images/menu_size_and_position.png" width= "350" height="120">
</picture>

Here we define the functions<span style="color:green;"> <ins>Activate, OpenMenu, and HideMenu</ins></span> for opening and closing the GUI, as well as defining parameters <span style="color:yellow;"> ***menuScale***</span> and <span style="color:yellow;">***menuShift***</span> for its position in relation to the gameobject. The scale and shift parameters should be configured in the inspector based on the size of the GUI you design.

The Activate, OpenMenu, and HideMenu functions are called from the manager script, described below in section 4. </br></br></br>

**Referencing the MRTK components from<span style="color:blue;">EP\_&lt;PluginName>_Menu.cs**</span>

<picture>
  <img align="left" alt="on off .png" src="./Images/on_off_.png" width= "200" height="100">
</picture>Here we declare references to the GameObjects and components of our MRTK elements, and grab the references for the two different button states in the <span style="color:green;"><ins>Start</ins></span> function:</br>




</br>

</br>
</br>

**Changing the state of the MRTK components from <span style="color:blue;">EP\_&lt;PluginName>_Menu.cs**</span>

<picture>
  <img align="left" alt="Toggle method.png" src="./Images/Toggle_method.png" width= "300" height="150">
</picture>The last step to complete the RandomScale menu script is to implement the visual behavior of the On/Off button with the <span style="color:green;"><ins>Toggle</ins></span> function, which turns the menu GameObjects on & off, and the visual behavior of the slider label with the <span style="color:green;"><ins>SetValText</ins></span> function. These functions are called from the manager script, described below in section 4.
</br></br></br></br></br></br>

<p></p>


## 4. Responding to menu interaction in<span style="color:blue;"> EP\_&lt;PluginName>_Manager.cs</span>

**Configuring the manager script so that the MenuGUI can be launched from the EffectsMenu Plugins page**
<picture>
  <img align="left"  alt="MenuOnGui.png" src="./Images/MenuOnGui.png" width= "300" height="300">
</picture>

The parameters <span style="color:yellow;">***menuGUIOn***</span> and <span style="color:yellow;">***savedMenuGUIOn***</span> are included at the beginning of the manager script to facilitate the menu appearing and disappearing in response to a Launch button on the Plugins page of the EffectsMenu for each plugin (each of which calls the function <span style="color:green;"><ins>ToggleMenuGUI</ins></span> to change the state of <span style="color:yellow;">***menuGUIOn***</span>)

Then, in the Update function, this code responds to the current state of the <span style="color:yellow;">***menuGUIOn***</span> boolean variable to call the <span style="color:green;"><ins>Activate & OpenMenu</ins></span>  functions when <span style="color:yellow;">***menuGUIOn***</span> is set to true, and to call the <span style="color:green;"><ins>HideMenu</ins></span> function when <span style="color:yellow;">***menuGUIOn***</span> is set to false.
</br></br></br></br></br></br>
**Configuring the manager script to update the effects model and GUI visuals in response to user interaction**



<picture>
  <img align="left"  alt="Respond to menu and slider.png" src="./Images/Respond_to_menu_and_slider.png" width= "300" height="200">
</picture>The final components of the menu system for the RandomScale plugin are these two functions in the manager script which respond to the user clicking the On/Off button and moving the slider on the GUI. Note that these functions change the parameters of <span style="color:yellow;">***myModel***</span> and update the visuals of the GUI using the functions defined above in <span style="color:yellow;">***myMenu***</span>.
</br></br></br></br></br></br>

## 5. Setting up the &lt;Plugin prefab>

Once the scripts are finished, we add the plugin to the scene by creating a prefab for the plugin.

We name the parent object EffectPlugin_RandomScale, and attach the scripts <span style="color:blue;">EP\_RandomScale_Manager.cs and <span style="color:blue;">EP\_RandomScale_Menu.cs</span>. 
	
<picture>
  <img alt="Setting up plugin" src="./Images/Settting_up_plugin.png" width= "800" height="260">
</picture>	

We create two child objects, the first one named PluginModel and attach the script <span style="color:blue;">EP\_RandomScale_Model.cs</span>. When the scene is running, we can check the <span style="color:yellow;">***isEnabled***</span> box to turn the plugin on and off (as well as change other settings in the inspector). 

The second child object we name MenuGUI and include it as a parameter in EP\_RandomScale_Menu vis the inspector (see above image). We omit the specific construction of the MenuGUI in this tutorial, since each GUI will be unique based on the needs of the plugin.
	
<picture>
  <img alt="Random scale model.png" src="./Images/Random_scale_model.png" width= "800" height="260">
</picture>	

Finally, to have the plugin available during runtime, we include EffectPlugin_RandomScale.prefab in the BasePrefabContainer prefab 

`(location: Assets/Iulian_Temp/Resources/InternalPrefabs/BasePrefabContainer.prefab)`

To do this, we open the BasePrefabContainer and drag our EffectPlugin_RandomScale.prefab into the <span style="color:yellow;">***PluginsToInstantiate_runAfter***</span> list in the Effect4Gen script in the inspector.

  <img alt="Instantiate after.png" src="./Images/Instantiate_after.png" width= "800" height="260">

## 6.  Instantiate a plugin-equipped object into the scene

Following this tutorial, any objects that are created from the 3D Object Menu during runtime will now be instantiated with the RandomScale Plugin prefab attached:

## 7)Things to keep in mind for more complex plugins

Some plugins are applied **before** normal effects (e.g. the Delay effect, which allows multiple objects to respond to the same signal after delays of different lengths)

Some plugins are applied **after** normal effects (e.g. the path plugin, which moves an object along a path.)


<p align="center">
<picture>
  <img alt="Effects Plugin.png" src="./Images/Effects_Plugin.png" width= "600" height="400">
	</picture></p>

For a more complex plugin like the Path plugin we need to send data structures like vectors and lists into the Photon stream. The photon network can’t stream lists or vectors so we just make sure to send the float values one at a time.

  <img alt="EP Path model.png" src="./Images/EP_Path_model.png" width= "350" height="120">

	The order in which we send variables into the photon stream…
<picture>
  <img alt="else photon stream.png" src="./Images/else_photon_stream.png" width= "570" height="350">

	must match the order in which we receive variables from the photon stream.


## Sample Scenes

### **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">EffectsMenuScene</span>**

<picture>
  <img align="right" src="./Images/image19.gif" width= "300" height="160">
</picture>

We have one arrow object (named <span style="text-decoration:underline;">ArrowTwist</span>) configured to rotate in the X and Y directions. This is done by using the EffectsMenu to control the object’s XRotate and YRotate effects with the channel C3, whose data stream rises and falls according to values from the function y=sin(x). 

### **Opening the EffectsMenu:**

<picture>
  <img align="right" src="./Images/Opening_Effects_Menu.png" width= "500" height="100">
</picture>

The scene is configured for the ArrowTwist object to begin with the rotation already activated. To open the EffectsMenu to change the rotation settings, you need to 



1. Click on the arrow object in the scene so that <span style="text-decoration:underline;">ArrowTwist</span> appears as the “Last edited object” in the text menu on the screen
2. Click the small button that says “FX” in the lower left corner of the text menu. Now the EffectsMenu should appear.

### **Adjusting the Rotation effects:**

The three buttons to the left of the Rotation panel each turn the rotation on/off - the first button in the X direction, the second in the Y direction, and the third in the Z direction.

By hovering the pointer over a button and clicking, the button will toggle (change) between Blue (in the off state) and Orange (in the On state).

Once in the On state, a slider will appear, where you can adjust the strength of the rotation in each direction. In the gif above, for example, the arrow starts with XRotation on, and then later we have both XRotation and YRotation on.

### **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">ManualDataChannelScene</span>**

We have one CubeFrame object (named <span style="text-decoration:underline;">CubeFrameGrow</span>) configured to change its x, y, and z-scales. 
<p align="center">
<picture>
	<img  src="./Images/image20.gif" >
	
</picture></p>

	Changing the size of an object using the slider on the ManualDataChannel

Open the effects menu, and use the AR hand (hold spacebar) to click on the effects menu sensor chart (move the AR hand against the surface of the chart to launch):

<p align="center">
<picture>
	<img  src="./Images/image21.gif" >
	
</picture></p>

	Clicking the sensor chart to launch the ManualDataChannel      	           

This opens up the ManualDataChannel, which is configured to control the size of the cube. This is done by toggling on all the XScale, YScale, and ZScale effects on the Scale tab of the EffectsMenu, and the channel “C4” activated on **both** the EffectsMenu **and** the ManualDataChannel. 

**Using the ManualDataChannel slider, change the size of the cube directly!**

<picture>
  <img align="right" alt="image3.gif" src="./Images/image3.gif" width= "400" height="200">
</picture>

In this scene we have a CubeFrame object (named <span style="text-decoration:underline;">CubeFrameRandomScale</span>) configured to resize randomly according to the RandomScale plugin.

Navigate to the Plugins tab in the EffectsMenu, and click the Launch button next to “Random Scale” to open the GUI (“Graphical User Interface”) for this plugin.

**To activate or deactivate the plugin effect, click the button labeled “On/Off” on the GUI (set to blue for “off” and set to orange for “on”).**
</br></br></br>
**Using the GUI slider, change the amount of random scaling applied to the game object, which is displayed as a float in the top right corner of the menu!**

### **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Path Plugin Scene</span>**

<picture>
  <img align="right"  src="./Images/image15.gif" width="400" height"200" >
</picture>

In this scene we have two arrow objects configured by the path plugin.

Each arrow travels along a path - one named <span style="text-decoration:underline;">ArrowPathPoints </span>moving along a path between user-defined points (visible roughly in the lower right corner of this gif), and the other named <span style="text-decoration:underline;">ArrowPathDrawing</span> moving along a path defined by a drawing (moving more erratically around the scene)

Navigate to the Plugins tab in the EffectsMenu, and click the Launch button next to “Path” to open the GUI (“Graphical User Interface”) for this plugin.

**To activate or deactivate the plugin effect, click the button labeled “On/Off” on the GUI!**
</br></br></br>
**To toggle the way the path follows positions, the two options are:**



1. **Click the button labeled “List” to define the path directly as a list of points**
2. **Click the button labeled “Drawing” to define the path as a hand-drawn sequence of points!**

Currently, the list of points has to be defined in the inspector as a list of Vector3s (interpreted as localPositions). The drawing needs to be added as a BaseLineDrawing object.
</br></br></br>
**To toggle the way the object is rotated as it follows the path, the three options are:**



1. **Click the button labeled “None” for no rotation**
2. **Click the button labeled “Forward” for the object to face its direction of movement**
3. **Click the button labeled “List” to define the rotations directly as a list of directions for the object to face!**

Currently, the list of rotations has to be defined in the inspector as a list of Vector3s (interpreted as localRotations)
